# Angular Todo

###Description
My first Angular.js app

A simple todo app (hello angular).

###Functionality
* Add todo.
* Remove todo.
* Delete todo.
* Mark todo as done.
* Delete all todos that are marked done.

All todos are stored in the browser's localStorage.

The app makes use of angular's built-in directives, custom directives, controllers, services, scopes.
